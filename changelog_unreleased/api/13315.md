#### Stop doc mutation in `prettier.doc.printDocToString` (#13315 by @fisker)

For performance reason, `prettier.doc.printDocToString` used to mutate `.parts` of the [`fill`](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/blob/main/commands.md#fill) command during print. It was converted to a [pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) to ensure output correctness.
